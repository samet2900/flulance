<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a web platform called FLULANCE in Turkish. It is a marketplace connecting Brands (employers) with Influencers (freelancers). The project has evolved through several phases.

Initially, the agent was tasked with fixing bugs and implementing an admin approval and job expiration system. After successfully completing that, the user provided a very extensive list of over 40 new features and bug fixes. The agent organized these into logical Etaps (Phases). After completing Etaps 1, 2, and 3, the user requested to skip Etap 4 and implement a specific subset of 7 features from Etap 5.
