<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a web platform called FLULANCE in Turkish. The platform is a marketplace connecting Brands (employers) with Influencers (freelancers), aiming to replace the need for traditional agencies.

The initial request included a simple landing page. However, the scope was significantly expanded to a full-featured marketplace with three user roles (Brand, Influencer, Admin), user authentication (email/password + Google OAuth), job posting, influencer profiles, a commission system, an admin panel for management, and a real-time chat feature.

Most recently, the user requested a major overhaul of the user experience and features, which was broken down into phases (FAZ). The current focus is on **FAZ 1**, which includes:
- A new user flow where login redirects to a central Home Feed instead of a dashboard.
- The Home Feed should display job listings and pinned announcements.
- Adding a dedicated Announcements page.
- Granting Admins CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for announcements.
- Enhancing the Brand profile to be editable with more details (company name, contact, etc.).
- Expanding the Create Job Post form with new fields like Delivery Time, Revision Policy, etc.
- Fixing UI/UX issues like non-functional navbar buttons and dropdowns.

**User's preferred language**: Turkish. The next agent MUST respond in Turkish.

**what currently exists?**
The project is a full-stack application using a FastAPI backend, React frontend, and MongoDB database.

- **Backend ():** A comprehensive API is in place, supporting authentication (JWT & Google OAuth), and full CRUD operations for Users, Profiles (Influencer & Brand), Job Posts, Applications, Matches, Chat, Announcements, Notifications, and Favorites. The database is populated with test data via a  script.
- **Frontend ():** The application has a multi-page structure including a Landing Page, a new  page which is the main post-login screen, and separate dashboards for Brands, Influencers, and Admins. An announcement management UI has been successfully added to the Admin Dashboard. The auth flow correctly redirects to the .

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was executing **FAZ 1** of the user's requests. It had just finished replacing the old modals in  with new, more detailed ones for Create Job Post and a new Edit Brand Profile modal. The agent used a  operation to inject the new JSX code for these modals.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. The agent should test the Brand Dashboard to verify that the new modals for editing a profile and creating a job with expanded fields are fully functional.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB (), Pydantic, JWT Authentication.
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Axios, TailwindCSS.
- **Architecture:** Full-stack, Single Page Application (SPA) with a RESTful API.

**key DB schema**
-   : {id, email, password_hash, user_type, name}
-   : {user_id, company_name, industry, website, logo_url, about}
-   : {id, brand_user_id, title, description, budget, delivery_time, revision_policy}
-   : {id, title, content, pinned, created_at}
-   Other collections: , , , , , .

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains the entire backend logic, including recently added models and endpoints for brand profiles and expanded job posts.
-   : The file currently being edited. It is a large component that now includes the JSX for profile editing and an enhanced job creation modal.
-   : The file likely containing the Profile Dropdown bug.
-   : Contains the recently completed announcement management feature.
-   : The new main entry point for logged-in users.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The main dashboard pages (, , ) have become large and monolithic. The logic for modals, data fetching, and different tabs could be extracted into smaller, more manageable child components to improve readability and maintainability.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Create/Update a brand's profile.
-   : Fetch the current brand's profile.
-   : Create a job post (expects new fields like ).
-   : Create an announcement.
-   : Update an announcement (e.g., to pin/unpin it).
-   : Get all announcements marked as pinned.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user has approved a phased development plan. You must complete **FAZ 1** before proceeding. The highest priority is to fix the **Profile Dropdown bug** and then complete the **Brand Dashboard enhancements**.
-   The user is highly engaged and provides specific feedback. Communicate your plan clearly before implementing and summarize your work afterward.
-   The React components for the dashboards are very large. Modifying them requires care. Breaking them into smaller components would be a good long-term strategy, but for now, focus on completing the user's immediate requests.

**Project Health Check:**

    -   The brand profile editing and enhanced job creation modals in the Brand Dashboard are incomplete (missing handler logic).
-   **Mocked:**
    -   None. The app uses a seed script to populate the real database with test data.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Google OAuth:** Used for social login. The agent used the  to get the playbook.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used:** NO
-   **Troubleshoot agent used:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None
-   **Known regressions:** The profile dropdown menu was likely working before but is now broken.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Admin:**  / 
-   **Brand:**  / 
-   **Influencer:**  / 

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent failed to address the critical Profile Dropdown Not Working bug reported by the user. It acknowledged the report but then immediately pivoted to implementing other features (announcements) and never returned to fix or verify the bug.
-   The agent added the UI for the new modals in  but did not complete the task by implementing the necessary handler functions to make them functional.</analysis>
